# Blueprint

aka **How We Collaborate** :zap:

##Overview

This document is an overview of the Vimeo Mobile and TV Group's product development process. It describes why process is important and outlines three aspects of our process: [team](#team), [workflow](#workflow), and [sprints](#sprints).

Why is process important? Process helps us to:
 
1. Advance the quality and stability of the software we make, and
2. Promote the development of an extraordinary team.
 
##Team
 
A product team is a co-located, cross-functional group of roughly 4-7 people who collaborate to bring ideas to life. Co-location facilitates communication. Cross-functionality fosters autonomy and self-sufficiency. Limiting team size promotes ownership.

*Team composition*

Teams are externally trusted, transparent, and accountable. Teams are internally creative, balanced, and practical. 

The goal of a team is to produce meaningful, high quality work at a predictable [pace](#notes).
 
##Workflow
 
Workflow is a structured approach to how a team evolves an idea from inception to production.
 
[Diagram] Workflow stages and deliverables
 
Teams evolve each idea one function at a time, with each function’s output being the next function’s input. Product defines the initial requirements, design uses these to define the UX and UI, engineering builds from design's blueprints, and QA determines whether the build meets our expectations.
 
An idea moves from one function to the next when the current function's output has been reviewed and approved by each of the other functions. This helps us make decisions when we have enough info to make them (not before, not after). It also ensures cross-functional ownership at each stage.
 
We solicit feedback early, ask questions often, and document and share what we learn along the way.
 
##Sprints
 
Sprints are structured 2-week intervals at which a team executes the above workflow to evolve an idea. Sprints help us establish [pace](#notes).
 
Before beginning a sprint we:
 
1. Assemble a rough list of stories that we would like to include in the sprint,
2. Assign each story to a team member,
3. Break each story into small, actionable chunks,
4. Assign an estimate to each chunk, and
5. Commit to a specific set of chunks by using our historical velocity to calculate per-person point commitments.
 
After finishing a sprint we hold a retrospective to discuss what went well, what went poorly, and what we decide to do differently next sprint.

##Notes

Pace - To track velocity, we use [Pace-iOS](https://github.com/vimeo/Pace-iOS) and [Pace-Android](https://github.com/vimeo/Pace-Android).
